# Diceware-Passphrase-Generator-

This project was created for the Computer Securty class at NSU.
Web Based Application so it can run in any computer. Basic HTML and CSS. Built with Java Script. 
Generates a random passphrase taking users specifications for length. Uses Diceware algorithm and wordlist for this. Wordlists created by Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
Simulates dice throws and picks a word depending on the results, repeats process for as many words that the user wants.
It can also generate an "acronym passphrase" where an user inputs a meaningful word and a passphrase is created made up of random words but each word starts with a letter of the word. So "Hello" results in "halo elephant lotus larvae opposite" 
For further details on the reasoning and importance behind creating a passphrase generator project plase read the report also uploaded to the repository,
